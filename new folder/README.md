# I'm trying to create a new folder.
- It seems that when I create a folder I have to ceate new file at the same time.

I want to know that how can I edit a html file in GitHub Desktop
Every time I create a file, the type of file is needed? I will try it in the next file.

<p>OK! Let me try html to figure out something.</P>
<ul>a test list
  <li style="color:blue;">example one</li>
  <li>example two</li>
</ul>
